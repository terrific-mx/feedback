## Tired of Feedback Chaos?
Terrific Feedback helps founders avoid wasting engineering resources by:
- 📥 **Centralizing scattered feedback** from Slack, emails, and support tickets
- 🚫 Preventing critical bugs from getting lost in endless threads
- ⏳ Stopping time drains on low-priority feature requests
- 📉 Reducing user churn through active listening
- 📢 Ending "silent shipping" of unreported features

## How Terrific Feedback Solves This
